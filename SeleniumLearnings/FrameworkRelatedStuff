#Page Object modelling
In page object modeling framework, we will divide our webpages into different files and whatever xpaths or functions are their we will 
add them into separate files.
Below is how we can create xpath for them. Package needed: SeleniumExtras.PageObjects
        private IWebDriver driver;
        public LoginPage(IWebDriver driver)
        {
            this.driver = driver;
            PageFactory.InitElements(driver, this);
        }

        [FindsBy(How = How.Id, Using = "username")]
        private IWebElement username;
        public IWebElement getUserName()
        {
            return username;
        }

We can then directly use the getUserName method or username and perform the operations.
