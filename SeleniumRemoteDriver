// Here we will see how can we setup remotedrivers for our testing

1) You should have jdk installed on your system as the files which we will use for creating server are jar files.
2) Download Selenium Server (Grid) from this url https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/
3) Once downloaded open command prompt with admin and as per requirment use below commands.
  To use as a standalone server: In standalone mode, you typically have both the hub and the node running on the same machine. 
This setup is useful for local testing or when you want to run tests on a single machine without distributing them across multiple nodes.
  CMD: java -jar server.jar standalone
  This command will create a node with chrome, edge, IE and firefox browser

  To use on multiple machines like hub and node.
  In this setup, you have a separate machine acting as the hub, which manages test distribution, and one or more machines acting as nodes, 
which execute the tests. This setup is useful for distributing tests across multiple machines to achieve parallel execution and better resource utilization.
  CMD: To create hub: java -jar server.jar hub
        To create node: java -jar server.jar node --selenium-manager true

While creating node, if you don't add '--selenium-manager true' tag, node will only create with chrome browser and to create node with multiple browsers add that tag.

C# Code for driver setup:
Driver setup will look like this:

RemoteWebDriver driver;
ChromeOptions Options = new ChromeOptions();
driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Url("http://localhost:4444/"), Options);
